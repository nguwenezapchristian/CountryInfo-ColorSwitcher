## Overview

This solution addresses the Frontend Mentor challenge involving the REST Countries API with a color theme switcher. The project showcases a dynamic web app using the API to display country information, offering a seamless light and dark mode switch. Leveraging FontAwesome, a moon icon is integrated into the search input. The design prioritizes responsive layout, utilizing HTML, CSS, and flexbox for efficient structure, while JavaScript enables the theme switcher. This solution exemplifies practical frontend skills applied to a real-world challenge.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode *(optional)*
